## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Tanisha"
print("Name is a constant because it never changes.")
var age = 32
print("Age is a variable because it changes as the user gets older.")
var stepsToday = 5000
print("Steps today is a variable because the number changes as the user walks. May be higher or lower.")
let goal = 10000
print("Goal is a contant because it does not change being that its a number the user is trying to reach.")
var heartRate = 72
print("Heart rate is a variable because it con change throughout the day.")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
